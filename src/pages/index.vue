        <h1>Hi, I'm Jonathan Walters</h1>

        <p>
            I like making things. I'm always looking for like-minded people so
            please reach out to me if you like making things too.
        </p>

        <p>
            Professionally I'm building the frontend for
            <a href="https://parrot.ai?utm_source=jdw.me">Parrot AI</a>. You can
            check out my work there. It has been very neat to see how video
            content embedded in documents changes the way you work on a team.

            Personally I always have a few things cooking. You can check out
